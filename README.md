# Pirate-Platformer

## :zap: About
This is my first attempt at creating a basic platformer stylegame usign the Godot game engine! I hope you like it!

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
I have not yet exported the project. So you'll need to run it using the Godot engine itself. Just clone the repository and import `project.godot` into the engine!

## :grey_question: Controls
- Move around with the left, right and up arrow keys.
- Select items in the menus with up and down arrow keys.
- Accept selected items with `enter` or `space`.
- Pause with `space`.
